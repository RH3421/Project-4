## Background
Globally, 1 in 71 children contract pneumonia every year. Unfortunately, pediatric pneumonia is also frequently fatal resulting in an estimated 2,200 deaths per day worldwide. To diagnose pediatric pneumonia, highly skilled physicians such as pediatric radiologists are needed to interpret the medical imaging. However, the distribution of these providers is highly disparate globally. 

## Business Problem
Countries with few pediatric radiologists per capita may have potentially higher risks of delays in diagnosis and corresponding treatment failures. Higher costs and interventional risks may also be worsened. Thus, our team endeavored to produce a diagnostic support tool, leveraging machine learning to speed and improve diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia. We believe our diagnostic support tool will be particularly useful in helping healthcare providers in countries with few pediatric radiologists per capita.

## Data Understanding

We used 5224 pediatric chest xrays to develop a diagnostic support tool that can differentiate between a normal chest xray (CXR) and a chest xray in a pediatric patient with pneumonia. There were 1341 normal CXR, 3883 pneumonia CXR. Recall was the metric of choice as failure to properly diagnose pneumonia (or false negative) could potentially be fatal to the child. Using recall allows us to try to reduce these false negatives.

## Modeling
We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to developed our diagnostic support tool as theyâ€™re good for image classification. CNNs are particularly strong when for image classification especially wehn geared towards color images.

## Results
Our diagnostic support tool achieved 95% recall, meaning that only 1 in 20 cases of actual pneumonia were incorrectly labeled.

## Conclusions
Given recent events, including a global pandemic that frequently resulted in pneumonia for those affected and overwhelmed healthcare resources, having a diagnostic support tool to accelerate diagnosis without adding strain to hospital staff is of enormous value. Our diagnostic support tool accurately identifies pediatric pneumonia 95% of the time. We think our diagnostic support tool could be particularly valuable in underserviced communities around the world where pediatric radiologists are scarce.

## Future Considerations
With more time and data we believe our diagnostic support tool can be further improved and may be applicable for evaluation of adult chest xrays. We also plan to refine our model toaccurately differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia. Additionally, incorporation clinical data, such vitals signs and blood lab tests, shoulder further improve our diagnostic support tool.
